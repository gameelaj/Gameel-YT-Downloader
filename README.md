# 📺 Gameel YT Downloader

A robust, resume-capable YouTube downloader built with **Python** and **Tkinter**. This application provides a modern GUI wrapper for `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`, offering advanced features like 4K video merging, exact time clipping, and smart file collision detection.

## ✨ Key Features

* **⏯️ Smart Resume System**: Detects partial downloads (`.part`) and resumes exactly where they left off, even after the app is closed.
* **✂️ Time Clipping**: Download specific segments of a video (e.g., "01:15 to 02:30") without downloading the whole file.
* **🎥 High-Fidelity Quality**: Auto-merges video/audio streams to support **4K (2160p)** and **2K (1440p)** MKV/WebM files.
* **🛡️ Collision Protection**: Uses "Smart Glob" logic to prevent overwriting existing files while ignoring thumbnails.
* **⚙️ Dependency Check**: Automatically detects if `ffmpeg` is missing and alerts the user.

## 🧠 Technical Challenges Solved
* **Concurrency**: Implemented Python `threading` to ensure the Tkinter GUI remains responsive during heavy download and FFmpeg merging processes.
* **State Management**: Developed a custom logic to track `.part` files, allowing the application to safely resume interrupted downloads.
* **File System Integrity**: Built a "Smart Glob" collision detector to prevent accidental file overwrites while managing multiple temporary media streams.
